# Cantotype

Cantonese phonetic typing app as a 100% client-side JavaScript webapp.

You just need three files:

- `cantotype.html` - the main webapp
- `cantotype_table.js` - the database
- `hkcs.woff` - the webfont for HKCS rendering

All three files must be on the same server directory.  The `cantotype.html` can be renamed anything, so long as it is in the same directory as the other two files.  The names of the other two files may not be changed without updating their paths within `cantotype.html`.

The `hkcs.woff` file is the only one that is not provided in this project.  You can use any WOFF font.  The CSS style on the webapp will use this font for rendering just the Chinese characters.

The `cantotype_table.js` file is generated by the `canto_compile.pl` Perl script.  This script generates the database from official HKSCS and Unihan databases.  See the documentation within the script for further information.
