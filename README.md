# Cantotype

Cantonese phonetic typing app as a 100% client-side JavaScript webapp.

You just need five files:

- `cantotype.html` - the main webapp
- `cantotype_table.js` - the database
- `freehk.woff` - the Free-HK webfont
- `notosanshk.woff` - the Noto Sans HK webfont
- `lastresort.woff` - the Last Resort webfont

All five files must be on the same server directory.  The `cantotype.html` can be renamed anything, so long as it is in the same directory as the other two files.  The names of the other two files may not be changed without updating their paths within `cantotype.html`.

The font files are not provided by this project.  You can get Free-HK from `freehkfonts.opensource.hk`.  Use `sfnt2woff` to convert it to WOFF, and make sure you rename the file `freehk.woff`.  You can get Noto Sans HK from Google Fonts.  To get a WOFF from it, take one of the OpenType files and run it through the `snft2woff` utility.  Cantotype expects the name of the font to be `notosanshk.woff`, so rename the result file if necessary.  You can get Last Resort from `unicode-org/last-resort-font` on GitHub.  The compiled TrueType font is available from the releases.  To get a WOFF from it, you can run it through the `snft2woff` utility.  Cantotype expects the name of the font to be `lastresort.woff`, so rename the result file if necessary.

The most widely supported characters will be rendered in the regular script with the Free-HK font.  This font does not include characters specific to Cantonese.  Characters that are not in Free-HK but available in Noto Sans HK will be displayed in that font.  This font includes characters specific to Cantonese.  For characters that are not available in either font, Last Resort will be used, which displays a generic box indicating which Unicode block the character belongs to.  This allows you to see in result lists how widely supported a character is by whether it appears as a regular script (widely supported), sans-serif (not so widely supported), or Last Resort (rare).

The `cantotype_table.js` file is generated by the `canto_compile.pl` Perl script.  This script generates the database from official HKSCS and Unihan databases.  See the documentation within the script for further information.
